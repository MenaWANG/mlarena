## Upgrading to v0.3.0

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes
- **Class renamed**: `ML_PIPELINE` ‚Üí `MLPipeline`
- **why?**: Follow Python PEP 8 naming conventions (classes use CapWords)

### üîß Action recommended:
- Find: `ML_PIPELINE`  
- Replace: `MLPipeline`

### üìÖ Timeline

- **v0.3.0**: `ML_PIPELINE` functional with deprecated warning
- **v0.4.0**: `ML_PIPELINE` support will be removed

### üìù Example

```python
# Before (v0.2.x)
from mlarena import ML_PIPELINE
pipeline = ML_PIPELINE(model=your_model)
results = ML_PIPELINE.tune(X, y, algorithm, preprocessor, param_ranges)

# After (v0.3.0+)  
from mlarena import MLPipeline
pipeline = MLPipeline(model=your_model)
results = MLPipeline.tune(X, y, algorithm, preprocessor, param_ranges)
```

Backward Compatibility: Your existing code still works! `ML_PIPELINE` shows a deprecation warning but functions normally:

```python
# This still works but shows a warning
from mlarena import ML_PIPELINE  # ‚ö†Ô∏è DeprecationWarning
```
