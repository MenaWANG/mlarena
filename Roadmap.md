# MLArena Development Roadmap

This document outlines the planned features, improvements, and changes for future releases of the MLArena package. The roadmap represents our current priorities and direction, though specific timelines are not guaranteed. Features may be added, modified, or reprioritized based on community feedback and evolving needs.

We welcome contributions and suggestions related to these roadmap items. If you're interested in implementing any of these features or have ideas for improvements, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request on our GitHub repository.

## Planned Features and Improvements

- **Enhanced Cross-Validation Flexibility**:
  - Allow user to specify splitter object for cross-validation in 
    - [x] `wrapper_feature_selection` and 
    - [ ] `tune` functions
  - [x] Support sklearn CV splitter objects (e.g., `TimeSeriesSplit`, `GroupKFold`, `LeaveOneGroupOut`, etc.)
  - [x] Maintain backward compatibility with existing `cv` parameter (defaults to `StratifiedKFold`/`KFold`)
  - [x] When `cv` is provided as a splitter object, use it directly; otherwise fall back to current default behavior
  - [x] Add examples demonstrating different CV strategies for specialized use cases (time series, grouped data, etc.)

- **Support for Fixed Parameters in Hyperparameter Tuning**:
  - [ ] Add `fixed_params` parameter to the `tune` method
  - Allow users to specify parameters that should remain constant during tuning
  - [ ] Combine fixed and tunable parameters when creating model instances
  - [ ] Maintain backward compatibility with existing usage patterns
  - [ ] Add examples demonstrating mixed fixed/tunable parameter scenarios
  - Enable common use cases like:
    - [ ] Setting algorithm-specific parameters that don't need tuning
    - [ ] Setting regularization parameters while tuning learning rates

- **Test and support for Python 3.13**:
  - [x] Add tests for Python 3.13
  - [x] Add support for Python 3.13

- **Extend Influence Analysis to Classifiers**:

  - [x] Generalize the `calculate_cooks_d_like_influence` method to handle classification models
  - Support probability-based metrics 
    - [x] Support MSE-like metrics for probability-based metrics in 1st iteration
    - [?] Support other probability-based metrics (e.g., Jensen–Shannon divergence, L2 distance, log-loss change) for measuring prediction shift
  - Ensure compatibility with binary classifiers using `predict_proba` 
  - [x] Maintain consistent output format and aggregation with regression version
  - [x] Add examples demonstrating influence detection on classification datasets
  - [x] Add comprehensive test coverage for classification models

- **Column Order Consistency for Predictions**:
  - Some tree-based libraries (e.g. XGBoost) rely on column position rather than column names during prediction. If the column order in test data differs from training data, the model will silently use wrong feature values, leading to incorrect predictions without raising errors. To protect its users against such silent errors, MLArena can add a consistency layer to automatically align column orders, preventing these issues from underlying algorithms and enhancing robustness across all supported algorithms.
  - [ ] Store training feature column order during `fit()` method
  - [ ] Automatically reorder prediction data columns to match training order in `predict()` method
  - [ ] Validate that all expected training columns are present in prediction data
  - [ ] Raise informative error if required columns are missing
  - [ ] Add optional warning when columns are automatically reordered
  - [ ] Add tests to verify correct behavior with mismatched column orders
  - [ ] Add examples demonstrating protection against XGBoost column order issues
