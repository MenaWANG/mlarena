An algorithm-agnostic machine learning toolkit for model training, diagnostics and optimization.

## Publications

Read about the concepts and methodologies behind MLArena through these articles:

1. [Algorithm-Agnostic Model Building with MLflow](https://medium.com/data-science/algorithm-agnostic-model-building-with-mlflow-b106a5a29535) - Published in Towards Data Science
   > A foundational guide demonstrating how to build algorithm-agnostic ML pipelines using mlflow.pyfunc. The article explores creating generic model wrappers, encapsulating preprocessing logic, and leveraging MLflow's unified model representation for seamless algorithm transitions.

2. [Explainable Generic ML Pipeline with MLflow](https://medium.com/data-science/explainable-generic-ml-pipeline-with-mlflow-2494ca1b3f96) - Published in Towards Data Science
   > An advanced implementation guide that extends the generic ML pipeline with more sophisticated preprocessing and SHAP-based model explanations. The article demonstrates how to build a production-ready pipeline that supports both classification and regression tasks, handles feature preprocessing, and provides interpretable model insights while maintaining algorithm agnosticism.

## Installation

The package is undergoing rapid development at the moment (pls see [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/MenaWANG/mlarena/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for details), it is therefore highly recommended to install with specific versions. For example

```bash
pip install mlarena==0.1.9
```

If you are using the package in Databricks ML Cluster with DBR runtime >= 15.2, you can try installing without dependencies (experimental feature):

```bash
pip install mlarena==0.1.9 --no-deps
```
